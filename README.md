# ðŸ’Ž RefineAI

**RefineAI** is a data-centric framework designed to improve the reliability of machine learning models â€” especially in safety-critical domains such as healthcare.  
It integrates two complementary stages:

1. **Filtering** hard or problematic training instances using **Instance Hardness (IH)** or **Influence Functions (IF)**.  
2. **Rejecting** predictions during inference using a **confidence-based** or **uncertainty-based** criterion.

By combining these two steps, RefineAI enhances data quality, model confidence, and prediction reliability while maintaining a practical balance between accuracy and coverage.

The best combination of thresholds (*Tf*, *Tr*) â€” which determine the extent of filtering and rejection â€” is selected by minimizing a **cost function** that balances predictive performance, rejection rate, and model confidence.

## ðŸ“š Case Studies

1. **Hospitalization_dengue** and **HSL** are real-world case studies conducted using routinely collected data from the **Brazilian Public Health System (SUS)**.  
2. **Heart**, **Lymph**, and **Bioresponse** are additional health-related datasets available on the [**OpenML**] repository and classified as *hard* datasets by [**TabZilla**].
